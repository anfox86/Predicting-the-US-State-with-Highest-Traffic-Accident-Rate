## Accident Rate and Severity - US Traffic Accident Rates
This repository contains all of the work completed for the Accident Rate and Severity - US Traffic Accident Rates project. 

### Description
For this project I wanted to look at the rate of traffic accident rates by different variables such as obstacle, weather, and time of day. I then wanted to see if the level of severity had any affect on where the accident was located. For example, do I have a higher severity level if the accident occurs at a traffic signal?
